Ideas:
    switch changing data structures to Lenses (floormaps, entities and its members)
    change GameState to monadic (could make its use easyer)

ToDo:
    use Random please...
    instance Random Floor where
    instance Random Entity where
    instance Random Hero where
    move GameState back to Logic

Bugs:
